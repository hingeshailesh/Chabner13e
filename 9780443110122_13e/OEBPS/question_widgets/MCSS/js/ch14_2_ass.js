        q: `Mark Scott is a 48-year-old man who has always been in good health. Six months ago he went to the ED at the local hospital complaining of fever and sudden swelling of his right hand from a cat scratch. He was admitted to the hospital for the hand infection. His blood lymphocyte count was very low, so a blood sample was sent to be tested for antibodies against HIV. Both ELISA and a Western blot revealed presence of anti-HIV antibodies. His CD4+ T cell count was very low at 170 [normal is 500 to 1600]. His physician prescribed trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia, and Mark also was given HAART. After 5 weeks of therapy, his HIV viral load declined to undetectable levels and his CD4+ T cell count rose. He remains well and active and works full time.`,
