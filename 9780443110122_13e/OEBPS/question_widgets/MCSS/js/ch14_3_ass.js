        q: `Mrs. Archer is a 55-year-old housewife who began to experience excessive fatigue. A blood sample revealed mild anemia and slightly lowered white blood cell count. Her sedimentation rate was elevated, and electrophoresis of serum proteins showed marked elevation of IgG. She returned for regular visits to her physician, and on each occasion serum IgG levels were gradually increasing. After she experienced sudden onset of upper back pain, a thoracic spine MRI study was performed and showed destruction of a portion of a vertebra. A bone marrow biopsy specimen showed a proliferation of plasma cells. She was given anticancer drugs bortezomib (Velcave) and lenalinamide (Relimid), but a year later she developed fever and chest pain. Chest x-ray revealed pneumonia, and antibiotics were given. The outlook for her survival is poor.`,
