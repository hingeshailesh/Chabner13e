        q: `John was a healthy baby until the age of 22 months, when he developed angioedema [swelling induced while eating a cookie containing peanut butter]. The symptoms disappeared in about an hour. A month later, while eating the same type of cookie, he started to vomit, became hoarse, had great difficulty in breathing, started to wheeze, and developed a swollen face. He was taken immediately to the ED of Children’s Hospital, where he was given a subcutaneous injection of epinephrine [adrenaline]. Within minutes of the epinephrine injection, John’s hoarseness decreased, the wheezing diminished, and his breathing was less labored. His parents were advised to avoid giving him foods containing peanuts in any form.`,
