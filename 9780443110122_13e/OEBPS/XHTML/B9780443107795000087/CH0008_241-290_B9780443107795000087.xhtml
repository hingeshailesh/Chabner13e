					<h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Introduction</h2>
					<div class="textfl" id="p0115">Sexual reproduction is the union of the <b>ovum</b> (female sex cell) and the <b>sperm</b> (male sex cell). Each sex cell, known as a <b>gamete,</b> has half the number of chromosomes needed to create a new organism. In <b>fertilization,</b> nuclei of the two gametes unite to form a single nucleus with half of the chromosomes and genetic code from each parent.</div>
					<div class="text" id="p0120">Special organs called <b>gonads</b> in males and females produce the egg and sperm cells. The female gonads are the <b>ovaries,</b> and the male gonads are the <b>testes.</b> After an ovum leaves the ovary during <b>ovulation</b>, it travels down one of two <b>fallopian tubes</b> leading to the <b>uterus</b> (womb). If <b>coitus</b> (copulation, sexual intercourse) has occurred, millions of sperm cells travel into the fallopian tubes, but only one sperm cell can penetrate the ovum. This is <b>fertilization.</b> The fertilized ovum is then known as a <b>zygote.</b> After many cell divisions, a ball of cells forms, and the zygote is called an <b>embryo</b> (2 to 8 weeks) and then a <b>fetus</b> (8 weeks to delivery). The period of development within the uterus is <b>gestation,</b> or <b>pregnancy.</b></div>
					<div class="text" id="p0125">The female reproductive system consists of organs that produce <b>ova</b> (singular; ovum) and provide a place for the growth of the embryo. In addition, the female reproductive organs supply important hormones that contribute to the development of female secondary sex characteristics (body hair, breast development, structural changes in bones and fat).</div>
					<div class="text" id="p0130">The eggs, or ova, are present from birth in the female ovary but begin to mature and are released from the ovary in a 21- to 28-day cycle when secondary sex characteristics develop during puberty. The occurrence of the first cycle is called <b>menarche.</b> Menstrual cycles continue until <b>menopause,</b> when all eggs have been released, hormone production diminishes, and menstruation ends. If fertilization occurs during the years between menarche and menopause, the fertilized egg may grow and develop within the uterus. A new, blood vessel–rich organ called a <b>placenta</b> (connected to the embryo by the umbilical cord) develops to nourish the embryo, which implants in the uterine lining. Various hormones are secreted from the ovary and from the placenta to stimulate the expansion of the placenta. If fertilization does not occur, hormonal changes result in the shedding of the uterine lining, and bleeding, or <b>menstruation,</b> occurs.</div>
					<div class="text" id="p0135">The hormones of the ovaries, <b>estrogen</b> and <b>progesterone,</b> play important roles in the processes of menstruation and pregnancy, and in the development of secondary sex characteristics. The <b>pituitary gland,</b> located at the base of the brain, secretes other hormones that govern the reproductive functions of the ovaries, breasts, and uterus.</div>
					<div class="text" id="p0140"><b>Gynecology</b> is the study of the female reproductive system (organs, hormones, and diseases); <b>obstetrics</b> (Latin <i>obstetrix</i> means midwife) is a specialty concerned with pregnancy and the delivery of the fetus; and <b>neonatology</b> is the study of the care and treatment of the newborn.</div>

						</div>
						<div class="text" id="p0155">The <b>vagina</b> [5], a tubular structure, extends from the uterus to the exterior of the body. <b>Bartholin glands</b> [6] are two small, rounded glands on either side of the vaginal orifice. These glands produce a mucous secretion that lubricates the vagina. The <b>clitoris</b> [7] is an organ of sensitive, erectile tissue located anterior to the vagina and in front of the urethral orifice. It is similar to the glans penis, which is the tip of the penis. The region between the vaginal orifice and the anus is the <b>perineum</b> [8].</div>
						<div class="text" id="p0160">The external genitalia of the female are collectively called the <b>vulva.</b> <a href="#f0015" id="Bf0015">Figure 8-2</a> shows the various structures that are part of the vulva.

						<div class="text" id="p0165"><a href="#f0020">Figure 8-3</a> shows an anterior view of the female reproductive system. Each <b>ovary</b> [1] is held in place on either side of the uterus by a <b>utero-ovarian ligament</b> [2].</div>
						<div class="text" id="p0170">Within each ovary are thousands of small sacs—the <b>ovarian follicles</b> [3]. Each follicle contains an <b>ovum</b> [4]. During <b>ovulation</b>, an ovum matures; its follicle ruptures through the surface and releases the ovum from the ovary. A ruptured follicle fills with yellow hormone-producing cells. It is then called the <b>corpus luteum</b> [5], meaning yellow body. The corpus luteum secretes hormones (both estrogen and progesterone) that maintain the very first stages of pregnancy.</div>
						<div class="text" id="p0175">A <b>fallopian tube</b> [6] is about 5½ inches long and lies near each ovary. Collectively, the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and supporting ligaments are the <b>adnexa</b> (accessory structures) of the uterus. The finger-like ends of the fallopian tube are the <b>fimbriae</b> [7]. They catch the egg after its release from the ovary. <b>Cilia</b> (small hairs) line the fallopian tube and, through their motion, sweep the ovum toward the uterus. It usually takes the ovum about 2 to 3 days to pass through the fallopian tube.</div>
						<div class="text" id="p0180">If sperm cells are present in the fallopian tube, fertilization may occur (<a href="#f0025" id="Bf0025">Figure 8-4</a>). If sperm cells are not present, the ovum remains unfertilized and eventually disintegrates in the abdominal cavity.</div>
						<div class="text" id="p0185">The fallopian tubes, one on each side, lead into the <b>uterus</b> [8], a pear-shaped organ with muscular walls and a mucous membrane lining filled with a rich supply of blood vessels. The rounded upper portion of the uterus is the <b>fundus,</b> and the larger, central section is the <b>corpus</b> (body of the organ). The inner layer, a specialized epithelial mucosa of the uterus is the <b>endometrium</b> [9]; the middle, muscular layer of the uterine wall is the <b>myometrium</b> [10]; and the outer, membranous tissue layer is the <b>perimetrium (uterine serosa)</b> [11], a lining that produces a watery, serum-like secretion. The outermost layer of an organ in the abdomen or thorax is also known as a serosa.</div>
						<div class="text" id="p0190">The narrow, lowermost portion of the uterus is the <b>cervix</b> [12] (Latin <i>cervix</i> means neck). The cervical opening leads into a 3-inch-long muscular, mucosa-lined canal called the <b>vagina</b> [13], which opens to the outside of the body.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="245" id="pagebreak_245" /><a id="pg245" /></div>

								<li class="unnumlist" id="p0255">If fertilization does <i>not</i> occur, the corpus luteum in the ovary stops producing progesterone and regresses. At this time, lowered levels of progesterone and estrogen probably are responsible for some women’s symptoms of depression, breast tenderness, and irritability before menstruation.

						<div class="textfl" id="p0265">If fertilization does occur in the fallopian tube, the fertilized egg travels to the uterus and implants in the uterine endometrium. The corpus luteum in the ovary continues to produce progesterone and estrogen. These hormones support the vascular and glandular development of the uterine lining.</div>
						<div class="text" id="p0270">The <b>placenta,</b> a vascular organ, now forms, attached to the uterine wall. The placenta is derived from maternal endometrium and from the <b>chorion,</b> the outermost membrane that surrounds the developing embryo. The <b>amnion,</b> the innermost of the embryonic membranes, holds the fetus suspended in an amniotic cavity surrounded by a fluid called the <b>amniotic fluid.</b> The amnion with its fluid also is known as the “bag of waters,” or amniotic sac, which ruptures (breaks) during labor.</div>
						<div class="text" id="p0275">The maternal blood and the fetal blood never mix during pregnancy, but important nutrients, oxygen, and wastes are exchanged as the blood vessels of the fetus (coming from the umbilical cord) lie side by side with the mother’s blood vessels in the placenta. <a href="#f0040" id="Bf0040">Figure 8-7A and B</a> shows implantation in the uterus and the embryo’s relationship to the placenta and enveloping membranes (chorion and amnion).</div>
						<div class="text" id="p0280">As the placenta develops, it produces its own hormone, <b>human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).</b> When women test their urine with a <b>pregnancy test kit</b>, presence or absence of hCG confirms or rules out that they are pregnant. This hormone stimulates the corpus luteum to continue producing hormones until about the third month of pregnancy, when the placenta takes over the endocrine function and releases estrogen and progesterone. Progesterone maintains the development of the placenta. Low levels of progesterone can lead to spontaneous abortion in pregnant women and menstrual irregularities in nonpregnant women.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="248" id="pagebreak_248" /><a id="pg248" /></div>

						<div class="text" id="p0285">The uterus normally lies within the pelvis.

						<div class="textfl" id="p0295">The events of menstruation and pregnancy depend on hormones not only from the ovaries (estrogen and progesterone) but also from the <b>pituitary gland.</b> The pituitary gland secretes <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="249" id="pagebreak_249" /><a id="pg249" /><b>follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)</b> and <b>luteinizing hormone (LH)</b> after the onset of menstruation.

						<div class="text" id="p0300">During pregnancy, the high levels of estrogen and progesterone from the ovary and placenta cause the pituitary gland to stop producing FSH and LH. Therefore, while a woman is pregnant, additional eggs do not mature and ovulation cannot occur. Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) work in the same way. <span class="icon1"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780443107795000087/main.assets/icon01-9780443107795.jpg" alt="icon"/></span></div>
						<div class="text" id="p0305">Another female birth control method is an <b>IUD (intrauterine device).</b> A health care professional inserts the IUD, a small device designed to remain inside the uterus. It works by preventing implantation of the embryo. Birth control pills and an IUD do not protect a woman against sexually transmitted infections. See page 274 for a table of contraceptive choices and their features.</div>

									<div class="b1textfl" id="bpar0010">Birth control pills contain a combination of estrogen and progesterone or progesterone only. When taken as directed, they increase the levels of these hormones in the woman’s bloodstream. High levels of estrogen and progesterone send a signal to the pituitary gland to shut down its secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). When these hormones are blocked, the ovaries will not release eggs, and pregnancy cannot occur. During pregnancy, levels of estrogen and progesterone also are high—and the ovaries will not release eggs then either! So birth control pills effectively fool the body into “thinking” that the woman is pregnant, and her ovaries stop releasing eggs.</div>
								</div>
							</aside>
						</div>
						<div class="text" id="p0310">When all of the ova are released and secretion of estrogen from the ovaries lessens, <b>menopause</b> begins. Menopause signals the gradual ending of menstrual cycles. Premature menopause occurs before age 40, whereas delayed menopause occurs after age 55. Artificial menopause occurs if the ovaries are removed by surgery or made nonfunctional as a result of radiation therapy or some forms of chemotherapy.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="250" id="pagebreak_250" /><a id="pg250" /></div>
						<div class="text" id="p0315">During menopause, when estrogen levels fall, the most common signs and symptoms are hot flashes (temperature regulation in the brain is disturbed), insomnia, and vaginal atrophy (lining of the vagina dries and thins, predisposing the affected woman to irritation and discomfort during sexual intercourse). <b>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT),</b> given orally or as a transdermal patch or vaginal ring, relieves these symptoms of menopause and delays the development of weak bones (osteoporosis). HRT use may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, endometrial cancer, stroke, or heart attack. This therapy should be used only after careful consideration of potential risks and benefits.</div>

Two types of ovarian cancer are most common: <b>serous</b> (clear fluid) and <b>mucinous</b> (thick, pasty fluid) <b>cystadenocarcinomas.</b> The tumor usually is discovered in an advanced stage as an abdominal mass and may produce few symptoms in its early stages. When the disease metastasizes beyond the ovary before diagnosis, <b>ascites</b> (accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity) is often present. Treatment consists of surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible (tumor <b>debulking</b>). This may include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and removal of the omentum (fatty tissue that covers abdominal organs and often contains deposits of tumor). Surgery is followed by systemic drug therapy, which is dependent on the type of ovarian cancer. A protein marker produced by tumor cells, CA 125, can be measured in the bloodstream to assess effectiveness of treatment.</div>
														<div class="tb1">Inherited mutations (changes) in genes greatly increase the risk of developing ovarian and breast cancer.

														<div class="tb1">The most common type of breast cancer is <b>invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC).</b> Invasive means that the tumor has spread to surrounding breast tissue. <a href="#f0100" id="Bf0100">Figure 8-19A</a> shows the tumor on a mammogram. <a href="#f0100">Figure 8-19B</a> shows a cut section of an invasive ductal carcinoma. Other histopathologic (histo- means tissue) types are <b>lobular</b> and <b>medullary carcinoma</b> of the breast.</div>
														<div class="tb1"><b>Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)</b> is non-invasive breast cancer. It starts in milk ducts and does not spread beyond its original location (in situ). DCIS can increase the risk of developing invasive breast cancer and is treated by lumpectomy.</div>
														<div class="tb1">Breast cancer spreads first to lymph nodes in the axilla (armpit) nearest the affected breast and then to the skin and chest wall. From the lymph nodes it also may metastasize to other body organs, including bone, liver, lung, and brain. The diagnosis is first established by biopsy, either core needle aspiration or surgical removal of the specimen (solid mass or area of microcalcification). A <b>stereotactic core needle biopsy</b> is performed with the help of mammography for guidance.</div>
														<div class="tb1">For small primary tumors, the lump with immediately surrounding tissue can be removed <b>(lumpectomy)</b>. To determine whether the tumor has spread to lymph nodes, a <b>sentinel node biopsy (SNB)</b> is performed. For this procedure, a blue dye or a radioisotope is injected into the tumor site and tracks to the axillary (underarm) lymph nodes. See <a href="#f0105" id="Bf0105">Figure 8-20</a>. After lumpectomy, radiation therapy to the breast and to any involved lymph nodes then follows to kill remaining tumor cells.</div>
														<div class="tb1">An alternative surgical procedure is <b>mastectomy</b> (<a href="#f0110" id="Bf0110">Figure 8-21A</a>), which is removal of the entire breast. After either lumpectomy or mastectomy if lymph nodes are involved, or if the primary tumor was large, <b>adjuvant</b> (aiding) chemotherapy is given to prevent recurrence of the tumor. Breast reconstruction is an option after mastectomy. See <a href="#f0110">Figure 8-21B</a>. In patients with large primary tumors, <b>neoadjuvant chemotherapy</b> (added prior to surgery) may be administered to reduce tumor bulk and allow for complete surgical removal of the tumor.</div>
														<div class="tb1">After surgery, further treatment may be indicated to prevent recurrence. To determine which treatment is best, it is important to test the breast cancer tumor for the presence of <b>estrogen receptors (ERs).</b> Two thirds of breast cancers are ER-positive (ER+). These receptor proteins indicate that the tumor will respond to therapy that blocks the stimulation of estrogen. If metastases should subsequently develop, this information will be valuable in selecting further treatment. There are two types of drugs that block the effects of estrogen and thereby kill ER-positive breast cancer cells.</div>

														<div class="tb1">A second receptor protein, <b>HER2,</b> is found in some breast cancers and signals a high risk of tumor recurrence. <b>Herceptin,</b> an antibody that binds to and blocks HER2, is effective in stopping growth when used with chemotherapy.

										<div class="b1text" id="bpar0325">Whenever May rolls around, I think about my surgery and the decision I made many years ago to have prophylactic mastectomies. I grew up in a family of strong women. They were determined to work, play sports, and raise their families, except they all had breast cancer. It was a bump in the road for each one of them and, at age 36, I had a lively family with four children, a wonderful career, and unfortunately, abnormal mammograms. I had friends, holidays, and biopsies, and being a physician (radiation oncologist) and the daughter of a medical oncologist, I was worried about my own health.</div>
										<div class="b1text" id="bpar0330">When my mother tested negative for the BRCA gene, it did not relieve my anxiety. It just intensified it. What was causing the breast cancer in my family? Genetic counselors explained that only about 10% of breast cancer can be attributed to the BRCA genes; the rest are caused by other “faulty genes” or mutations in the breast cells.</div>
										<div class="b1text" id="bpar0335">I heard about a new procedure that physicians were pioneering—direct-to-implant breast reconstruction after mastectomy. One step and one surgery would drop my risk from 40% to close to 2% or 3%. I could preserve my anatomy and get rid of those breast cells that might kill me someday. It had a lot to do with my family and career. I did not want to have breast cancer.</div>
										<div class="b1text" id="bpar0340">So I decided, after much research and discussion, to have prophylactic mastectomies with reconstruction. After my surgery, my mother was there when I woke up from anesthesia, and I have never seen her so relieved. I accepted a lot of help taking care of the kids, and farmed out the lawn maintenance for a while. Few people had heard of prophylactic mastectomy at the time of my surgery, but I was convinced that it meant I might very well “dodge a bullet.”</div>
										<div class="b1text" id="bpar0345">Almost two decades later, I smile when I see women openly sharing breast health issues on newsfeeds and social media. They talk about new approaches for treatment, such as neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, oncoplastic surgery, nipple-sparing, hormonal therapy, and immunotherapy all in the same story. It’s wonderful that women can talk about their “faulty parts” without feeling shame. It’s a great example for our daughters as well.</div>
										<div class="b1text" id="bpar0350">Almost a decade ago, the actress Angelina Jolie wrote an op-ed, discussing her oophorectomy and salpingectomy surgery. Women with BRCA genes have an increased risk not only for breast cancer but also for ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer, unlike breast cancer, is often diagnosed at a very late stage. Most breast cancers are diagnosed at stage 1 or 2 or even at a “pre-cancer” DCIS [ductal carcinoma in situ] stage. Ovarian cancer, on the other hand, often is diagnosed after the cancer has already spread. Prophylactic removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes in a young, premenopausal woman sends her into early menopause. This results in hot flashes, skin changes, and dryness (you know where!). These are hard topics to discuss in public, but important to destigmatize the subject for all women. There is no history of ovarian cancer in my family, and we are BRCA-negative, so my genetic counselor did not recommend removing my ovaries and fallopian tubes at that time. But now there are new genes that can be tested for, and that, along with better radiologic techniques and blood tests, can hopefully bring information to high-risk families.</div>
										<div class="b1text" id="bpar0355">Because of my decision to undergo prophylactic mastectomies, I know that my life has changed for the better. I don’t have the fear of getting breast cancer. I also have decided to devote my life’s work to helping women recover with comfort, dignity, and grace after being blindsided by the disease. Knowledge is power! It behooves us to learn as much as we can to prevent disease and proactively take care of the fragile, precious thing we call our health.</div>
										<div class="b1text" id="bpar0360"><i>Elizabeth Chabner is the CEO/Founder of Masthead, a company devoted to bringing innovative products to patients with breast cancer. She is a physician, rower, swimmer, cross-country skier and the proud mother of four children ages 20-25.</i></div>
