                <div class="textfl" id="p0120">The lymphatic system and the immune system are considered together in
                    this chapter because aspects of their functions in the body are very closely related.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0125"><b>Lymph</b> is a clear, watery fluid that surrounds body cells and flows
                    in a system of thin-walled lymph vessels (the lymphatic system) that extends throughout the body.
                </div>
                <div class="text" id="p0130">Lymph differs from blood, but it has a close relationship to the blood
                    system. Lymph fluid does not contain erythrocytes or platelets, but it is rich in two types of white
                    blood cells (leukocytes): <b>lymphocytes</b> and <b>monocytes</b>. The liquid part of lymph is
                    similar to blood plasma in that it contains water, salts, sugar, and wastes of metabolism such as
                    urea and creatinine, but it differs in that it contains less protein. Lymph actually originates from
                    the blood. It is the same fluid that filters out of tiny blood capillaries into the spaces between
                    cells. This fluid that surrounds body cells is called <b>interstitial fluid</b>. Interstitial fluid
                    passes continuously into specialized thin-walled vessels called <b>lymph capillaries</b>, which are
                    found coursing through tissue spaces (<a href="#f0015" id="Bf0015">Figure 14-1</a>). The fluid in
                    the lymph capillaries, now called <b>lymph</b> instead of interstitial fluid, passes through larger
                    lymphatic vessels and through clusters of lymph tissues (<b>lymph nodes</b>), finally reaching large
                    lymphatic vessels in the upper chest. Lymph enters these large lymphatic vessels, which then empty
                    into the bloodstream. <a href="#f0020" id="Bf0020">Figure 14-2</a> illustrates schematically the
                    relationship between the blood and the lymphatic systems. <a href="#t0010" id="Bt0010">Table
                        14-1</a> reviews the differences between lymph and blood.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0135">The lymphatic system has several functions. First, it is a drainage system
                    to transport needed proteins and fluid that have leaked out of the blood capillaries (and into the
                    interstitial fluid) back to the bloodstream via the veins. Second, the lymphatic vessels in the
                    intestines absorb lipids (fats) from the small intestine and transport them to the bloodstream.
                </div>
                <div class="text" id="p0140">A third function of the lymphatic system relates to the <b>immune
                        system:</b> the defense of the body against foreign organisms such as bacteria and viruses.
                    Lymphocytes and monocytes, originating in bone marrow, lymph nodes, and organs such as the spleen
                    and thymus gland, protect the body by producing antibodies and by mounting a cellular attack on
                    foreign cells and organisms.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="515"

                        childhood it is quite large, but it becomes smaller with age. The thymus gland is composed of
                        nests of lymphoid cells resting on a platform of connective tissue. It plays an important role
                        in the body’s ability to protect itself from disease (immunity), especially in fetal life and
                        during the early years of growth. It is known that a thymectomy (removal of the thymus gland)
                        performed in an animal during the first weeks of life impairs the ability of the animal to make
                        antibodies and to produce immune cells that fight against foreign antigens such as bacteria and
                        viruses. Thus, the thymus gland is important in development of an effective immune system in

                        toxins that damage tissues and organs. <b>Natural immunity</b> is <b>resistance present at
                            birth.</b> It is not dependent on previous exposure to an antigen. With natural immunity,
                        after an initial exposure to to an antigen, there is no memory of the initial encounter. An
                        example of natural immunity is the body’s handling of a bacterial infection. White blood cells
                        respond immediately to the intruding antigens. <b>Neutrophils</b> travel to the infected area
                        and ingest bacteria. Other white blood cells, such as <b>monocytes</b>, <b>macrophages</b>, and
                        <b>lymphocytes (NK</b> or <b>natural killer cells),</b> also participate in the body’s natural
                        immunity against infection. Typically, there is no immunologic memory (ability to remember
                        antigens on pathogens) with natural immunity.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0225">In addition to natural immunity, a healthy person can develop
                        <b>adaptive immunity.</b> This is the body’s ability to <b>recognize</b> and <b>remember</b>
                        specific antigens in an immune response. <b>Lymphocytes (T and B cells)</b> are part of adaptive
                        immunity. <b>T cells recognize</b> and <b>remember</b> specific antigens and produce stronger
                        and more rapid attacks each time the antigen is encountered. <b>B cells</b> secrete
                        <b>antibodies</b> against antigens. Think of what happens when you have a cold or the flu: You
                        are exposed to a viral antigen. Your B cells secrete antibodies, which not only destroy the
                        virus but remain in the blood so that when the virus reappears, at a later time, you have
                        adaptive immunity to it! Another example of adaptive immunity is that achieved with
                        <b>vaccination.</b> You are given an injection of a killed virus or protein that doesn’t make
                        you ill, but stimulates your B cells to secrete antibodies and stimulates T cells to recognize
                        and kill the intruders. If you are exposed to the virus or protein again, you will have a more
                        rapid immunologic response because of the previously made antibodies and stimulated T cells
                        (adaptive immunity).</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0230">In certain instances, more immediate adaptive immunity is necessary.
                        Poisons (toxins) that rapidly cause major damage (for example, snake venom) can be counteracted
                        by giving ready-made antibodies, called <b>antitoxins</b>, produced in another organism.
                        Injections of other ready-made antibodies, such as <b>immunoglobulins</b>, can boost your
                        adaptive immunity before you travel to a foreign country. Infants acquire adaptive immunity when
                        they receive <b>maternal antibodies</b> through the placenta, before birth, or in breast milk.

                        bacteria). This is what happens: The B cell matures into another cell called a <b>plasma
                            cell.</b> It is the plasma cell that produces antibodies called <b>immunoglobulins,</b>
                        which block the effects of antigens. Examples of immunoglobulins <b>(Ig = immunoglobulin)</b>
                        are <b>IgM, IgA, IgG, IgE,</b> and <b>IgD.</b> One maternal immunoglobulin, <b>IgG,</b> crosses
                        the placenta to provide immunity for newborns. Another, <b>IgE,</b> is important in allergic

                    <div class="text" id="p0240"><b>Cell-mediated immunity</b> does not involve antibodies. Rather, it
                        involves several types of <b>T cells</b> with different functions. For example, <b>cytotoxic T
                            cells (CD8+ T cells)</b> attach to antigens and directly kill the cells expressing the
                        antigen. Cytotoxic cells also secrete <b>cytokines (interferons and interleukins)</b>, which aid
                        other cells in antigen destruction. <b>Helper T cells (CD4+ T cells)</b> assist B cells in
                        making antibodies and they stimulate T cells to attack antigens. <b>Suppressor T cells</b> (also
                        called <b>regulatory T cells,</b> or <b>Tregs</b>) inhibit both B and T cells and prevent them
                        from attacking the body’s own good cells. <a href="#f0050" id="Bf0050">Figure 14-8</a> reviews

                    <div class="text" id="p0245">The adaptive immune system is helped by a number of other proteins and
                        cells found in circulating blood. One of these is the <b>complement system,</b> a group of

                        which initiates adaptive immunity by presenting antigens to T and B cells, showing them
                        precisely what they need to counteract. A number of cell types can present antigens to T cells,

                                <div class="b1text" id="p0370">When I began noticing persistent back pain and fatigue,
                                    my doctor and I didn’t take the symptoms seriously until the next year, when I
                                    noticed I was losing weight and short of breath. I saw a lung specialist, who took a
                                    chest x-ray and discovered a mass the size of a grapefruit in my mediastinum.
                                    Immediately, my stress level went sky high, and being 25 in New York City on my own
                                    (my family was in California and my mother was going through metastatic breast
                                    cancer treatment), I felt afraid and alone.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p0375">I was scheduled for a PET-CT scan and visited a friend
                                    who was a radiation oncologist. She was alarmed by my symptoms and appearance and
                                    through her father, a medical oncologist, immediately put me in contact with a
                                    cancer specialist. The results from the PET-CT plus bronchoscopy with a biopsy and
                                    from a bone marrow biopsy confirmed that I had Stage 2B Hodgkin lymphoma with “bulky
                                    disease” [large tumor mass] in my mediastinum. This diagnosis was really scary for
                                    me. But watching my mother go through her difficult battle with breast cancer made
                                    me realize that if I emulated her positive attitude, it would make life easier for
                                    my entire family.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p0380">The treatment was six cycles of chemotherapy. After two
                                    cycles, enough of my hair started falling out that I shaved my head. A Powerport was
                                    installed in my upper chest so that I could receive the chemotherapy more quickly
                                    and with less pain. Because I was so young, I received hormones to put my body into
                                    temporary menopause to preserve my fertility.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p0385">Three months into my treatment a PET-CT showed that the
                                    mass was still large, and it was likely that I would need radiation to my chest
                                    after the chemotherapy. By the time I was finishing my chemotherapy, I was having a
                                    difficult time coping with the ongoing side effects and time in the hospital.
                                    Nevertheless, I rallied and traveled to Boston for 4 weeks of proton [powerful
                                    radiation] therapy. I actually felt lucky to be receiving this cutting-edge
                                    treatment, delivered by one of the few proton beam machines in the country.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p0390">My radiation treatment ended, and a follow-up PET-CT scan
                                    would tell me if I needed further treatment. I remember when the doctor told me that
                                    the scan was all clear, I said, “Great!”—and then went outside and cried on a bench
                                    for an hour. More recently, I’ve been getting follow-up scans every year. Honestly,
                                    I’m relieved when the scan is clear, but I am also afraid and aware of the
                                    possibility of recurrence and of developing a secondary cancer as a result of the
                                    extensive radiation treatment. Since my mother passed away, I’ve been getting
                                    regular mammograms, and because of the radiation effects on my thyroid gland, I’m
                                    taking thyroid hormone to treat hypothyroidism.</div>

                                    empowered me to start a new, exciting business and think optimistically about the

                                        specializes in the treatment of patients with lymphoma.</i></div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p0635">Of the many challenges of practicing medical oncology,
                                    the treatment of patients with lymphoma is among the most satisfying, and at times
                                    the most difficult. Lymphomas were the first common solid tumor to become curable
                                    with drugs alone. In 1969, investigators at the National Cancer Institute published
                                    their promising results with combination chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma. At that
                                    time, this was a tumor that was treatable and curable with radiation therapy in only
                                    a small fraction of patients, when disease was limited to involvement of only a few
                                    lymph nodes. Very soon thereafter, chemotherapy proved to be curative for almost one
                                    half of patients with a more aggressive disease—large B-cell lymphocytic lymphoma, a
                                    malignancy that affects 20,000 new subjects every year in the United States. In
                                    succeeding years, for patients not cured with conventional drugs, bone marrow
                                    transplantation following ultra-high-dose chemotherapy salvaged at least half of
                                    those patients who experienced a relapse of disease. New drugs, particularly
                                    monoclonal antibodies that attack proteins on the surface of tumors and initiate
                                    immune destruction of tumors, have added to that success. Thus, at present, with the
                                    use of chemotherapy, irradiation, and high-dose drug treatment, most patients with
                                    lymphoma can be cured.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p0640">The experience of treating a patient with lymphoma is not
                                    simple. The first step is making the correct diagnosis, which requires obtaining an
                                    adequate biopsy specimen from the involved lymph nodes, bone marrow, or other
                                    disease sites. Next, the physician must establish the sites and extent of disease.
                                    This requires x-ray, MR imaging of the lungs, and spinal cord PET/CT (combination of
                                    nuclear medicine and computed tomography tests). The choice of drug regimens and
                                    other treatments depends on making a correct assessment of these factors.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p0645">The doctor must explain all of this information to the
                                    patient so that he or she has a clear understanding of what lies ahead. The
                                    long-term plan of management involves numerous hospital outpatient visits for
                                    evaluation and treatment, including possible biopsy and repeat biopsy of sites of
                                    disease to establish whether the tumor has been effectively treated. I also spend
                                    considerable time with patients explaining the potential side effects of treatments,
                                    some of which can affect the lungs, heart, and immune system. In addition, patients
                                    need guidance after chemotherapy about susceptibility to serious infections when
                                    blood counts are low. Overall, the psychologic stress and uncertainty of outcome
                                    plus the impact on work and family responsibilities make the need for support from
                                    friends and family crucial.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p0650">For most patients, all of these issues are successfully
                                    managed during treatment, and no experience is more gratifying for me, as an
                                    oncologist, than to achieve cure of a potentially lethal disease. All of this is
                                    accomplished at a price. For a few patients, the stresses of disease and its impact
                                    on family and work prove nearly overwhelming. I call upon the intervention of social
                                    workers, nurses, and even psychiatrists to help my patients deal with the difficulty
                                    of disease and life-changing experiences. The added rigors of bone marrow
                                    transplantation increase the burden on patients who are not cured by conventional
                                    treatments. Finally, even more stressful and demanding are the challenges faced by
                                    those patients, a minority to be sure, whose disease progresses despite all
                                    interventions, and who are destined not to survive. For these patients, experimental
                                    treatments at times are the best option and again may reverse the downward course.
                                    Through it all, as a physician, I find that we must all work as a team to provide
                                    the best medical advice, psychologic support, and hope for the 60,000 new patients
                                    who develop lymphoma each year.</div>
