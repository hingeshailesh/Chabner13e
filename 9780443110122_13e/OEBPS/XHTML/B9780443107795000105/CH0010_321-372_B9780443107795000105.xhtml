                <div class="textfl" id="p0125">The nervous system is one of the most complex of all human body systems.
                    More than 100 billion nerve cells operate constantly all over the body to coordinate the activities
                    we do consciously and voluntarily, as well as those that occur unconsciously or involuntarily. We
                    speak, move muscles, hear, taste, see, and think. Our glands secrete hormones, and we respond to
                    danger, pain, temperature, and touch. All of these functions comprise only a small number of the
                    many activities controlled by the nervous system.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0130">Fibers exiting from microscopic <b>nerve cells</b> (<b>neurons</b>) are
                    collected into macroscopic bundles called <b>nerves,</b> which carry electrical messages all over
                    the body. External stimuli, as well as internal chemicals such as <b>acetylcholine,</b> activate the
                    cell membranes of nerve cells, which results in electrical discharges of these cells. These
                    electrical discharges, <b>nervous impulses,</b> may then traverse the length of the associated
                    nerves. External <b>receptors</b> (sense organs) as well as internal receptors in muscles and blood
                    vessels receive these impulses and may in turn transmit impulses to the complex network of nerve
                    cells in the brain and spinal cord. Within this central part of the nervous system, impulses are
                    recognized, interpreted, and finally relayed to other nerve cells that extend out to all parts of
                    the body, such as muscles, glands, and internal organs.</div>

                <div class="textfl" id="p0135">The nervous system is classified into two major divisions: the <b>central
                        nervous system (CNS)</b> and the <b>peripheral nervous system (PNS).</b> The central nervous
                    system consists of the <b>brain</b> and <b>spinal cord.</b> The peripheral nervous system consists
                    of <b>cranial nerves</b> and <b>spinal nerves, plexuses,</b> and <b>peripheral nerves</b> throughout
                    the body (<a href="#f0010" id="Bf0010">Figure 10-1</a>). Cranial nerves carry impulses between the
                    brain and the head and neck. The one exception is the tenth cranial nerve, called the <b>vagus
                        nerve.</b> It carries messages to and from the neck, chest, and abdomen. <a href="#f0015"
                        id="Bf0015">Figure 10-2</a> shows cranial nerves, their functions, and the parts of the body
                    that they carry messages to and from. Spinal nerves carry messages between the spinal cord and the
                    chest, abdomen, and extremities.</div>

                    cervical, brachial (brachi/o means arm), and lumbosacral plexuses are examples that include
                    cervical, lumbar, and sacral nerves. <a href="#f0010">Figure 10-1</a> illustrates the relationship

                    respond to changes in the outside world. They include sense <b>receptors</b> for sight (eye),
                    hearing and balance (ear), smell (olfactory), and touch (skin sensation) and <b>sensory (afferent)
                        nerves</b> that carry messages related to changes in the environment <i>toward</i> the spinal
                    cord and brain. In addition, <b>motor (efferent) nerves</b> travel <i>from</i> the spinal cord and
                    brain to muscles of the body, telling them how to respond. For example, when you touch a hot stove,
                    temperature and pain receptors in the skin stimulate afferent nerves, which carry messages toward
                    the spinal cord and brain. Instantaneously, the message is conveyed to efferent nerve cells in the
                    spinal cord, which then activate voluntary muscles to pull your hand away from the stove.<span

                    Impulses pass along the parts of a nerve cell in a definite manner and direction. The parts of a
                    neuron are pictured in <a href="#f0030" id="Bf0030">Figure 10-5</a>; label it as you study the
                    following.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0170">A <b>stimulus</b> begins an impulse in the branching fibers of the neuron,
                    which are called <b>dendrites</b> [1]. A change in the electrical charge of the dendrite membranes
                    is thus begun, and the nervous impulse moves along the dendrites like the movement of falling
                    dominoes. The impulse, traveling in only one direction, next reaches the <b>cell body</b> [2], which
                    contains the <b>cell nucleus</b> [3]. Small collections of nerve cell bodies outside the brain and
                    spinal cord are called <b>ganglia</b> (<i>singular</i>: <b>ganglion</b>). Extending from the cell
                    body is the <b>axon</b> [4], which carries the impulse away from the cell body. Axons can be covered
                    with a fatty tissue called myelin. The purpose of this <b>myelin sheath</b> [5] is to insulate the
                    axon and speed transmission of the electrical impulse. Demyelination is loss of the myelin
                    insulating the nerve fiber and is characteristic of multiple sclerosis, an acquired illness
                    affecting the CNS.</div>

                <div class="text" id="p0180">The nervous impulse passes through the axon to leave the cell via the
                    <b>terminal end fibers</b> [6] of the neuron. The space where the nervous impulse jumps from one
                    neuron to another is called the <b>synapse</b> [7]. The transfer of the impulse across the synapse
                    depends on the release of a chemical substance, called a <b>neurotransmitter,</b> by the neuron that
                    brings the impulse to the synapse. See the boxed diagram in <a href="#f0030">Figure 10-5</a>. Tiny
                    sacs (vesicles) containing the neurotransmitter are located at the ends of neurons, and they release
                    the neurotransmitter into the synapse. <b>Acetylcholine, norepinephrine, epinephrine (adrenaline),
                        dopamine, serotonin,</b> and <b>endorphins</b> are examples of neurotransmitters.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0185">Whereas a neuron is a microscopic structure within the nervous system, a
                    <b>nerve</b> is macroscopic, able to be seen with the naked eye. A nerve consists of many axons that
                    travel together like strands of rope. Peripheral nerves that carry impulses <i>to</i> the brain and
                    spinal cord from stimulus receptors like the skin, eye, ear, and nose are <b>afferent</b> or
                    <b>sensory nerves;</b> those that carry impulses <i>from</i> the CNS to organs that produce
                    responses, such as muscles and glands, are <b>efferent</b> or <b>motor nerves.</b></div>
                <div class="text" id="p0190">Neurons and nerves are the <b>parenchyma</b> of the nervous system.
                    Parenchyma is the essential distinguishing tissue of an organ. In the brain and spinal cord,
                    neurons, which conduct electrical impulses, are the parenchymal tissue. <b>Stroma</b> of an organ is
                    the connective and supportive tissue of an organ. The stromal tissue of the central nervous system
                    consists of the <b>glial (neuroglial) cells,</b> which make up its supportive framework and help it
                    ward off infection. Gli/o comes from the Greek <i>glia</i> meaning glue. Glial cells do not transmit
                    impulses. They are far more numerous than neurons and can reproduce.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0195">There are four types of supporting or glial cells (see <a href="#f0035"
                        id="Bf0035">Figure 10-6</a>). <b>Astrocytes (astroglial cells)</b> are star-like in appearance
                    (astr/o means star) and transport water and salts between capillaries and neurons. <b>Microglial
                        cells</b> are small cells with many branching processes (dendrites). As phagocytes, they protect
                    neurons in response to inflammation. <b>Oligodendroglial cells (oligodendrocytes)</b> have few
                    (olig/o means few or scanty) dendrites. These cells form the myelin sheath in the CNS. By contrast,
                    <b>ependymal cells</b> (Greek <i>ependyma</i> means upper garment) line membranes within the brain
                    and spinal cord where CSF is produced and circulates.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0200">Glial cells, particularly the astrocytes, are associated with blood vessels
                    and regulate the passage of potentially harmful substances from the blood into the nerve cells of
                    the brain. This protective barrier between the blood and brain cells is called the <b>blood-brain
                        barrier (BBB).</b> This barrier consists of special lining (endothelial) cells, which along with
                    astrocytes separate capillaries from nerve cells. Delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to treat brain
                    tumors is thus difficult, because the BBB blocks drug access to brain tissues. <a

                <div class="textfl" id="p0205">The brain controls body activities. In the human adult, it weighs about 3
                    pounds and has many different parts, all of which control different aspects of body functions.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0210">The largest part of the brain is the “thinking” area, or <b>cerebrum.</b>
                    On the surface of the cerebrum, nerve cells lie in sheets, which make up the <b>cerebral cortex.</b>
                    These sheets, arranged in folds called <b>gyri,</b> are separated from each other by grooves known
                    as <b>sulci.</b> The brain is divided in half, a right side and a left side, which are called
                    <b>cerebral hemispheres.</b> Each hemisphere is subdivided into four major lobes named for the
                    cranial (skull) bones that overlie them. <a href="#f0040" id="Bf0040">Figure 10-7</a> shows these
                    lobes—frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal—as well as gyri and sulci.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0215">The cerebrum has many functions. It is responsible for thought, judgment,
                    memory, association, and discrimination. In addition, sensory impulses are received through afferent
                    cranial nerves, and when registered in the cortex, they are the basis for perception. Nerve impulses
                    from the cerebrum extend to muscles and glands producing movement as well as internal changes in the
                    body. <a href="#f0040">Figure 10-7</a> shows the location of some of the centers in the cerebral
                    cortex that control speech, vision, smell, movement, hearing, and thought processes.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0220">In the middle of the cerebrum are spaces, or canals, called
                    <b>ventricles</b> (pictured in <a href="#f0045" id="Bf0045">Figure 10-8</a>). They contain a watery
                    fluid that flows throughout the brain and around the spinal cord. This fluid is <b>cerebrospinal
                        fluid (CSF),</b> and it protects the brain and spinal cord from shock by acting like a cushion.
                    CSF usually is clear, colorless, and contains lymphocytes, sugar, and proteins. Spinal fluid is
                    withdrawn for diagnosis or relief of pressure on the brain; this is called a <b>lumbar puncture
                        (LP).</b> For this procedure, a hollow <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak"

                            space</b> [2] is below the dural membrane. The second layer surrounding the brain and spinal
                        cord is the <b>arachnoid membrane</b> [3]. The arachnoid (spider-like) membrane is loosely
                        attached to the other meninges by web-like fibers, so there is a space for fluid between the
                        fibers and the third membrane. This is the <b>subarachnoid space</b> [4], containing CSF. The

                        It contains delicate (Latin <i>pia</i>) connective tissue with a rich supply of blood vessels.

                                                    (peculiar sensations that precede the onset of illness). Symptoms of

                                            lefty out of necessity didn’t go so well. Over the past decade, I had slowly

                                            had become entrapped and scarred from repeated injury. Over the years, I
                                            tolerated this situation because other nerves had remained unaffected,
                                            providing sensation and function to my hand. It was only when I saw myself
                                            in a video (my hand looked like a claw) that I recognized how compromised
                                            the function of the hand had become.</div>

                                            specialist, testing revealed poor sensation and atrophy of my right hand
                                            muscles. My grip strength was also affected and was now actually stronger on
                                            my left rather than my right.</div>
                                        <div class="b1text" id="bpar0090">Surgery was scheduled immediately with hopes
                                            of halting atrophy and clawing of my hand and regaining sensation in my
                                            pinky. My surgeon performed an Eaton procedure. He moved the scarred ulnar
                                            nerve from its vulnerable path and placed sutures to hold the ulnar nerve in
                                            its new place under the fascia (connective tissue) of my elbow. He created a
                                            little “curtain” with the fascia to keep the nerve from moving again. This
                                            ultimately allowed the nerve to take a “shortcut” on the way to my hand
                                            while taking tension off the injured nerve and keeping it away from the bony
                                            prominence of the elbow.</div>
                                        <div class="b1text" id="bpar0095">When I awoke from the anesthesia, I could
                                            immediately tell that something was different about my hand. I had tingling
                                            in my previously numb fingers and soon had a warm sensation and even
                                            sweating in my palm. These findings demonstrated the return of the autonomic
                                            function of the nerve, something that had also been affected by the
                                            long-standing injury.</div>
                                        <div class="b1text" id="bpar0100">My arm was in a sling until my post-op

                                            scar just after the 2-week postoperative check. A compression sleeve
                                            prevented swelling and reminded me not to use my arm too much.</div>
                                        <div class="b1text" id="bpar0105">At 3 months postsurgery I was back to my usual
                                            routine of typing, writing, and using my hand. Sensation gradually returned
                                            to my pinky, and the function in my hand improved as well but very slowly.
                                            Injured nerves can regenerate as long as they are not cut or completely
                                            crushed. The nerve heals from proximal to distal (starting at the elbow and
                                            working toward the tip of the finger). Doctors quote the statistic of a
                                            millimeter a day for nerve regeneration, or roughly an inch per month. The
                                            feeling in my pinky is still not normal, but it is improving, and it’s
                                            encouraging to notice the progress. The muscles in my hand are also getting
                                            stronger. The true test will be to check my grip strength when I return for
                                            my 6-month follow-up appointment.</div>

                                            right leg; periods of speech arrest; diminished comprehension in reading;
                                            and recent development of a hemiplegic gait. Given the gradually progressive
                                            development of neurologic difficulties, he was suspected of having a left
                                            parietal tumor. [The parietal lobes of the cerebrum are on either side under

                                            severe pain in his right shoulder. On turning his head or lifting his
                                            shoulder, he experienced extreme discomfort and lancinating pain. The pain
                                            was a sharp, burning pain that moved across his shoulder and down into his
                                            right arm. Finding a comfortable position lying down was difficult. A
                                            cervical MRI study showed no bone abnormalities, whereas a neurologic
                                            examination provided evidence of damage to multiple peripheral nerves. He
                                            developed weakness of his shoulder muscles and was unable to lift his right
                                            arm. Final diagnosis was brachial plexus neuritis [also known as
                                            Parsonage-Turner syndrome]. The cause of the condition is unknown, but it
                                            may be related to a flu vaccination he received 2 weeks previously.

                                            her mid-forties living with sciatica.</i>I wouldn’t have believed that
                                        reaching into a laundry basket could change my life. But in January 2009, it
                                        did.</div>
                                    <div class="b1text" id="bpar0420">I had gotten my first-ever backache a few days
                                        earlier, after a long car trip. A Google search instructed me to apply ice for
                                        the first 48 hours and then heat if the pain persisted. My husband took over the
                                        kids’ school-day routine while I recuperated. That third morning, I could hear
                                        my younger son rifling around for his favorite sweatshirt; I knew it was at the
                                        foot of my bed, waiting to be sorted. In the instant it took to reach into the
                                        laundry basket for that sweatshirt, my back went from dull ache to a crippling
                                        pain that radiated all the way down my left leg to the tip of my left foot.
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="b1text" id="bpar0425">An MRI scan confirmed the diagnosis: spinal disc
                                        herniation, protruding onto the nerve roots affecting the sciatic nerve and
                                        causing my leg pain. With surgery presented as a last resort, I embarked on a
                                        crash course of physical therapy, NSAIDs, oral steroids, muscle relaxants,
                                        epidural steroid injections, and lots and lots of patience. I saw gradual
                                        improvement for about three months, to the point that I was able to resume a
                                        modified daily routine.</div>
                                    <div class="b1text" id="bpar0430">Then, the improvement stopped. Conventional
                                        treatment had run its course. I was at the “last resort” stage. So I “cried
                                        uncle” and requested a surgical consult. The surgeon ordered a follow-up MRI,
                                        which showed good news: There had been much improvement to the herniation. To my
                                        surprise, the MRI also revealed that nerve roots supplying the sciatic nerve
                                        were now free and clear of impingement. If the nerve was back to normal, why was
                                        I still in such pain? Because, it turns out, the nerve was injured by its
                                        ordeal. Not uncommon, I was reassured. This development took the surgical option
                                        off the table. After all, the goal of the surgery would have been to relieve the
                                        affected nerve from compression by the protruding disc. In my case, even the
                                        relieved nerve was causing problems, and that meant not surgery, but more
                                        patience. The wait began: to see whether the nerve would repair itself—I was
                                        told that could take years—or worse, whether I was facing permanent nerve
                                        damage.</div>
                                    <div class="b1text" id="bpar0435">Three years later the verdict seems clear: my
                                        sciatic nerve sustained what appears to be permanent damage. To this day, I have
                                        not regained full use of my left leg. Along with chronic, dull pain, there are
                                        also paresthesias—simultaneous burning and numbness along the path of the
                                        sciatic nerve accompanied by constant involuntary muscle spasms. I’ve lost my
                                        Achilles jerk reflex, and so unresponsive is my left foot that I can’t feel it
                                        hit the ground when I’m walking.</div>
                                    <div class="b1text" id="bpar0440">In those critical first months, I thought my
                                        options were either resolving the herniation with surgery or resolving it
                                        without surgery. It never once occurred to me that, four years later, the injury
                                        would remain unresolved.</div>
                                    <div class="b1text" id="bpar0445">There’s always a new treatment, specialist, or
                                        drug that shows promise or that really worked for a friend of a friend. Until
                                        recently, it felt like I was giving up hope if I didn’t pursue each lead. Now
                                        I’m focusing more on adapting to my new circumstances than on finding a “cure.”
                                        I don’t want my whole life to revolve around sciatica. I found a medication that
                                        reduces the chronic pain to more of an annoyance than a crisis (with occasional
                                        flare-ups).</div>

                                        risk of sounding like a late-night pharmaceutical ad, I’m not giving up; I’m
                                        going on.</div>
