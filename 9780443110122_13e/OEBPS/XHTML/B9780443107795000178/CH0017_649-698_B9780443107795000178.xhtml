					<h2 class="h1hd" id="st0020">Introduction</h2>
					<div class="textfl" id="p0145">The <b>eye</b> and the <b>ear</b> are sense organs, like the skin, taste buds, and <b>olfactory</b> (centers of smell in the nose) regions. As such, they are receptors whose sensitive cells may be activated by a particular form of energy or stimulus in the external or internal environment. The sensitive cells in the eye and ear respond to the stimulus by initiating a series of nerve impulses along sensory nerve fibers that lead to the brain.</div>
					<div class="text" id="p0150">No matter what stimulus affects a particular receptor, the resulting sensation is determined by regions in the brain connected to that receptor. Thus, mechanical injury that stimulates receptor cells in the eye and the ear may produce sensations of vision (flashes of light) and sound (ringing in the ears). If a workable connection could be made between the sensitive receptor cells of the ear and the area in the brain associated with sight, it would be possible to “see” sounds.</div>
					<div class="text" id="p0155"><a href="#f0015" id="Bf0015">Figure 17-1</a> reviews the general pattern of events that occur when such stimuli as light and sound are received by sense organs such as the eye and the ear.</div>

						<div class="textfl" id="p0160">Label <a href="#f0020" id="Bf0020">Figure 17-2</a> as you read the following:</div>
						<div class="text" id="p0165">Light rays enter the central dark opening of the eye, the <b>pupil</b> [1], which is surrounded by the colored portion of the eye, or <b>iris</b> (see the photo inset). The <b>conjunctiva</b> [2] is a membrane lining the inner surfaces of the eyelids and anterior portion of the eyeball over the white of the eye. The conjunctiva is clear and almost colorless except when blood vessels are dilated. Dust and smoke may cause the blood vessels to dilate, giving the conjunctiva a reddish appearance—commonly known as bloodshot eyes. Also, the same blood vessels may dilate when the eye is infected or inflamed by allergies. This condition is known as conjunctivitis.</div>
						<div class="text" id="p0170">Before entering the eye through the pupil, light passes through the <b>cornea</b> [3]. The cornea is a fibrous, transparent tissue that extends like a dome over the pupil and iris. The function of the cornea is to bend, or <b>refract,</b> the rays of light so that they are focused properly on the sensitive receptor cells in the posterior region of the eye. The normal, healthy cornea is avascular (has no blood vessels) but receives nourishment from blood vessels near its junction with the opaque white of the eye, the <b>sclera</b> [4]. Corneal transplants for people with scarred or opaque corneas are often successful because antibodies responsible for rejection of foreign tissue usually do not reach the avascular, transplanted corneal tissue. The sclera is a fibrous layer under the conjunctiva. It extends from the cornea on the anterior surface of the eyeball to the optic nerve in the posterior of the eye.</div>
						<div class="text" id="p0175">The <b>choroid</b> [5] is a dark brown membrane inside the sclera. It contains many blood vessels that supply nutrients to the eye. The choroid is continuous with the pigment-containing <b>iris</b> [6] and the <b>ciliary body</b> [7] in the anterior portion of the eye. The choroid, iris, and ciliary body are known as the <b>uvea</b> of the eye.</div>
						<div class="text" id="p0180">The iris is the colored portion of the eye (it can appear blue, green, hazel, gray, or brown), which has a circular opening in the center that forms the pupil. Muscles of the iris constrict <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="651" id="pagebreak_651" /><a id="pg651" />the pupil in bright light and dilate the pupil in dim light, thereby regulating the amount of light entering the eye.</div>

						</div>

						<div id="group5_placeholder" class="question-group"></div>

						<div class="text" id="p0185">The ciliary body surrounds the outer rim of the <b>lens</b> [8] in circular fashion for a full 360 degrees. There are fine, thread-like attachments (zonules) that connect the ciliary body to the lens, allowing the muscles in the ciliary body to adjust the shape and thickness of the lens. These changes in the shape of the lens cause <b>refraction</b> of light rays. Refraction is the bending of rays as they pass through the cornea, lens, and other tissues. Muscles of the ciliary body produce flattening of the lens (for distant vision) and thickening and rounding of the lens (for close vision). This refractory adjustment to focus on an object from far to near is called <b>accommodation.</b> When people get older, their eyes’ ability to accommodate decreases, so they may need magnifying glasses to see close objects and to read.</div>
						<div class="text" id="p0190">Besides regulating the shape of the lens, the ciliary body also secretes a fluid called <b>aqueous humor,</b> which is found in the <b>anterior chamber</b> [9] of the eye. Aqueous humor maintains the shape of the anterior portion of the eye and nourishes the structures in that region. The fluid is constantly produced and leaves the eye through a canal that carries it into the bloodstream. The posterior cavity of the eye is the <b>vitreous chamber,</b> which is the large region behind the lens filled with a soft, jelly-like material, the <b>vitreous humor</b> [10]. Vitreous humor (often referred to as the vitreous) maintains the shape of the eyeball and is not constantly re-formed. Its escape (due to trauma or surgical damage) may result in significant damage to the eye, leading to possible retinal damage and blindness. Both the aqueous and the vitreous humors further refract light rays.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="652" id="pagebreak_652" /><a id="pg652" /></div>
						<div class="text" id="p0195">The <b>retina</b> [11] is the thin, delicate, and sensitive nerve layer of the eye. As light energy, in the form of waves, travels through the eye, it is refracted (by the cornea, lens, and fluids), so that it focuses on sensitive receptor cells of the retina called the <b>rods</b> and <b>cones.</b> There are approximately 6.5 million cones and 120 million rods in the retina. The cones function in bright levels of light and are responsible for color and central vision. There are three types of cones, each stimulated by one of the primary colors in light (red, green, or blue). Most cases of color blindness affect either the green or the red receptors so that the two colors cannot be distinguished from each other. Rods function at reduced levels of light and are responsible for peripheral vision and vision in dim light.</div>
						<div class="text" id="p0200">When light rays are focused on the retina, a chemical change occurs in the rods and cones, initiating nerve impulses that then travel from the eye to the brain via the <b>optic nerve</b> [12]. The region in the eye where the optic nerve meets the retina is called the <b>optic disc</b> [13]. Because there are no light receptor cells in the optic disc, it is known as the blind spot of the eye. The <b>macula</b> [14] is a small, oval area of the retina adjacent to the optic disc. It contains a central depression called the <b>fovea centralis</b> [15], which is composed largely of cones and is the location of the sharpest vision in the eye. If a portion of the fovea or macula is damaged, vision is reduced and central-vision blindness occurs. <a href="#f0025" id="Bf0025">Figure 17-3</a> shows the retina of a normal eye as seen through an ophthalmoscope. The <b>fundus</b> of the eye is this posterior, inner part that is visualized through the ophthalmoscope.</div>
						<div class="text" id="p0205"><a href="#f0030" id="Bf0030">Figure 17-4</a> illustrates what happens when you look at an object and “see” it. If an object is in your <b>left visual field</b> (purple area), sensitive cells—rods and cones—in the <b>right</b> half<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="653" id="pagebreak_653" /><a id="pg653" /> of each <b>retina</b> (labeled A in the figure) are stimulated. Similarly, if an object is in your <b>right visual field</b> (orange color), rods and cones are stimulated in the left half of each retina. Nervous impulses then travel along optic nerve fibers from each retina and then merge to form the <b>optic chiasm</b> (B). Here, medial optic nerve fibers cross and temporal fibers do not. Thus, fibers from the right half of each retina (purple color) form an <b>optic tract</b> (C) leading, via the <b>thalamus</b> (relay center), to the <b>right visual cerebral cortex</b> (D). Similarly, fibers from the left half of each retina (orange color) form an optic tract leading to the <b>left visual cerebral cortex</b> (D). Images (one from each eye) are then fused in the occipital lobe of the brain, producing a single visual sensation with the three-dimensional effect. This is <b>binocular vision.</b></div>

												<div class="tb1">This condition occurs in both a “dry” and a “wet” form. <b>Dry macular degeneration</b> (affecting about 85% of patients) is marked by atrophy and degeneration of retinal cells and deposits of clumps of extracellular debris, or <b>drusen.

												<div class="tb1">Currently there is no standard treatment for the dry form of macular degeneration although there are many clinical trials in progress.

Over the past 20 years, regular injections, as frequently as once a month into the vitreous jelly, with anti-angiogenic drugs, such as Avastin, have become the mainstay of treatment for wet macular degeneration. These medications promote the regression of abnormal blood vessels and, as a result, decrease hemorrhaging and fluid leakage. More traditional treatment with laser photocoagulation of the leaking vessels is still done in some patients when the leakage is very localized and well visualized.

						<div class="textfl" id="p0310">Sound waves are received by the outer ear, conducted to special receptor cells within the ear, and transmitted by those cells to nerve fibers that lead to the auditory region of the brain in the cerebral cortex. Sensations of sound are perceived within the nerve fibers of the cerebral cortex. Label <a href="#f0115" id="Bf0115">Figure 17-21</a> as you read the following paragraphs describing the anatomy and physiology of the ear.</div>
						<div class="text" id="p0320">The ear can be divided into three separate regions: outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear. The outer and middle ears function in the conduction of sound waves through the ear, and the inner ear contains structures that receive the auditory waves and relay them to the brain.</div>
						<section><a id="s0090" />
							<h4 class="h3hd" id="st0100">Outer Ear</h4>
							<div class="textfl" id="p0325">Sound waves enter the ear through the <b>pinna,</b> or <b>auricle</b> [1], which is the projecting part, or flap, of the ear. The <b>external auditory meatus (auditory canal)</b> [2] leads from the pinna and is lined with numerous glands that secrete a yellowish brown, waxy substance called <b>cerumen.</b> Cerumen lubricates and protects the ear canal.</div>
						</section>
						<section><a id="s0095" />
							<h4 class="h3hd" id="st0105">Middle Ear</h4>
							<div class="textfl" id="p0330">Sound waves travel through the auditory canal and strike a membrane between the outer and the middle ear. This is the <b>tympanic membrane,</b> or <b>eardrum</b> [3]. As the eardrum vibrates, it moves three small bones, or <b>ossicles,</b> that conduct the sound waves through the middle ear. These bones, in the order of their vibration, are the <b>malleus</b> [4], the <b>incus</b> [5], and the <b>stapes</b> [6]. As the stapes moves, it touches a membrane called the <b>oval window</b> [7], <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="671" id="pagebreak_671" /><a id="pg671" />which separates the middle from the inner ear.</div>
							<div class="text" id="p0335">Before proceeding with the pathway of sound conduction and reception into the inner ear, an additional structure that affects the middle ear should be mentioned. The <b>auditory</b> or <b>eustachian tube</b> [8] is a canal leading from the middle ear to the pharynx. It normally is closed but opens on swallowing. In an efficient way, this tube can prevent damage to the eardrum and shock to the middle and inner ears. Normally the pressure of air in the middle ear is equal to the pressure of air in the external environment; however, if you ascend in the atmosphere, as in flying in an airplane, climbing a high mountain, or riding a fast elevator, the atmospheric pressure, along with that in the outer ear, drops, while the pressure in the middle ear remains the same—greater than in the outer ear. This inequality of air pressure on the inside and outside of the eardrum forces the eardrum to bulge outward and potentially burst if the difference in pressures increases. Swallowing opens the eustachian tube so that air can leave the middle ear and enter the throat until the atmospheric and middle ear pressures are balanced. The eardrum then relaxes, and the danger of its bursting is averted.</div>
						</section>
						<section><a id="s0100" />
							<h4 class="h3hd" id="st0110">Inner Ear</h4>
							<div class="textfl" id="p0340">Sound vibrations, having been transmitted by the movement of the eardrum to the bones of the middle ear, reach the inner ear via the fluctuations of the oval window that separates the middle and inner ears. The inner ear is also called the <b>labyrinth</b> because of its circular, maze-like structure. The part of the labyrinth that leads from the oval window is a bony, snail shell–shaped structure called the <b>cochlea</b> [9]. The cochlea contains special auditory liquids called <b>perilymph</b> and <b>endolymph</b> through which the vibrations travel. Also present in the cochlea is a sensitive auditory receptor area called the <b>organ of Corti.</b> In the organ of Corti, tiny hair cells receive vibrations from the auditory liquids and relay the sound waves to <b>auditory nerve fibers</b> [10], which end in the auditory center of the cerebral cortex, where these impulses are interpreted and “heard.”<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="672" id="pagebreak_672" /><a id="pg672" /></div>

								<div class="b1text" id="p0435">One day, while out for my usual walk, I sneezed on account of the higher seasonal pollen in our area. It was not an easy sneeze, and I was aware of the result immediately: I noticed some new floaters in my left eye. No pain, but a little feeling that something wasn’t right. I did not see flashes of bright light (a good thing).</div>
								<div class="b1text" id="p0440">I hoped that the floaters would minimize and when they did not, I called my optometrist for an appointment. My appointment was at 10:30, and by 11:00 he had discovered a possible tear in my left retina. He walked me down the hall to an ophthalmologist, who confirmed the tear and suggested cryopexy, which involves numbing the eye, inserting an external probe into the area of the eye and freezing the torn retina to the back of the eye. I was through all of this by 11:30. Timing is everything.</div>
								<div class="b1text" id="p0445">The ophthalmologist explained that waiting two or three days could have allowed the tear to progress to a detachment—which, if not caught, could cause more serious problems.</div>
								<div class="b1text" id="p0460">The bad news is that I couldn’t play golf for a couple of weeks after the cryopexy. My left eye looked horrible (itching and swollen) and I had a bunch of dark floaters in it. It was like trying to dodge three or four gnats right in front of my face. The good news is that my vision was intact.</div>
								<div class="b1text" id="p0465">My doctor told me that once you have had one episode, there is a 15% chance of developing the same problem in the other eye. Right on schedule, a year later, my right eye had a tear/separation. This time, though, the separation was located on the nasal side of the eye, which precluded using the cryogenic method of sealing the retina. My ophthalmologist decided on a laser treatment. After numbing the eye and putting me in the correct position, the doctor proceeded to light up my eye with 30 very bright flashes. He finished in 15 seconds.</div>
								<div class="b1text" id="p0470">Needless to say, both eyes are fine. However, I still have floaters in both eyes and occasionally swipe at nonexistent gnats.</div>
								<div class="b1text" id="p0475">It may have no relation, but my golf handicap has dropped four shots lower since last spring and two below my historical prior low. Isn’t technology great or what?!</div>

								</div>
								<div class="b1text" id="p4005">Having suffered from severe myopia since I was young, I actually looked forward to cataract surgery. The thought of not having to wear thick eyeglasses or contact lenses anymore was vastly appealing. I also had many friends who had had the surgery and remarked that it was relatively painless and within a week they had the best and clearest vision of their lives. As we age it is common for the lens of the eye to become cloudy although cataracts can occur in younger people as well.</div>
								<div class="b1text" id="p4015">Most people don’t realize how much their vision has deteriorated because it is a slow, gradual process, causing difficulties driving at night and needing stronger lighting to read. The stage of a cataract is evaluated on a scale of 1 to 10. My right eye was graded as a 6 and my left eye a 5. My ophthalmologist scheduled the surgery for one eye and then three weeks later for the other. I needed a special lens to correct my myopia and astigmatism.</div>
								<div class="b1text" id="p4025">Before surgery, I had three eye scans to determine the correct intraocular lens power, make a 3D map of the corneal surface, and an OCT scan to detect abnormalities in the macular region of the retina.</div>
								<div class="b1text" id="p4035">The surgery was outpatient and lasted less than an hour. A nurse put a series of drops in my eyes, and, after receiving a light sedative, I was awake during the surgery. My ophthalmologist performed phacoemulsification beginning with an incision on the side of the cornea through which an ultrasound device broke up the cloudy lens into small fragments. The lens fragments were vacuumed out and replaced with the new intraocular lens (IOL). A postsurgical eye shield was taped over my eye, and I was instructed to apply three different drops three times a day (antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drugs).</div>
								<div class="b1text" id="p4045">One of the first things I noticed was how everything was brighter and colors more vibrant. After my operation I was watching a war movie, and when I looked through my bad eye at the soldier’s uniform, it appeared brown; switching to the good eye, his uniform was blue! It still seems rather amazing to me that I lived in a brownish-yellow world for so long without realizing it. And it is such a nice feeling to get up in the morning and not reach for a pair of glasses anymore.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" aria-label="682" id="pagebreak_682" /><a id="pg682" /></div>
