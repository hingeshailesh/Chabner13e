                <div class="textfl" id="p0135">The primary function of blood is to maintain a constant environment for
                    the other living tissues of the body. Blood transports nutrients and gases to cells and wastes away
                    from cells of the body. Nutrients from food, digested in the stomach and small intestine, pass into
                    the bloodstream through the lining cells of the small intestine. Blood then carries these nutrients
                    to all body cells. Oxygen enters the body through the air sacs of the lungs. Red blood cells then
                    transport the oxygen to cells throughout the body. Blood also helps remove the waste products
                    released by cells. It carries gaseous waste (such as carbon dioxide) to the lungs to be exhaled. It
                    carries chemical waste, such as urea, to the kidneys to be excreted in the urine.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0140">Blood transports chemical messengers called hormones from their sites of
                    secretion in glands, such as the thyroid or pituitary, to distant sites where they regulate growth,
                    reproduction, and energy production. These hormones are discussed later in the endocrine chapter, <a

                        bones. Both the red blood cells that carry oxygen and the white blood cells that fight infection
                        arise from the same blood-forming or <b>hematopoietic stem cells.</b> Under the influence of
                        proteins in the blood and bone marrow, stem cells change their size and shape to become
                        specialized, or <b>differentiated.</b> In this process, the cells change in size from large
                        (immature cells) to small (mature forms), and the cell nucleus shrinks (in red cells, the
                        nucleus actually disappears). <a href="#f0015" id="Bf0015">Figure 13-1</a> illustrates these

                        loses its nucleus and assumes the shape of a biconcave disk. This shape (a depressed or hollow
                        surface on each side of the cell, resembling a cough drop with a thin central portion) allows
                        for a large surface area so that absorption and release of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) can
                        take place (<a href="#f0020" id="Bf0020">Figure 13-2A and B</a>). Red cells contain the unique

                        (protein). Hemoglobin enables the erythrocyte to carry oxygen. The combination of oxygen and

                        (meaning attraction to). This reflects their affinity for various dyes. <b>Eosinophils</b>
                        contain granules that stain with eosin, a red acidic dye. These cells increase in allergic
                        responses and engulf substances that trigger the allergies. <b>Basophils</b> contain granules
                        that stain dark blue with a basic (alkaline) dye. These granules contain heparin (an
                        anticlotting substance) and histamine (a chemical released in allergic responses).
                        <b>Neutrophils</b> contain granules that are neutral; they do not stain intensely and show only
                        a pale color. Neutrophils are <b>phagocytes</b> (<b>phag/o</b> means to eat or swallow) that

                        stimulates red blood cell production (erythropoiesis). Normally erythropoietin is made by the
                        kidney. Thus patients with kidney failure can become anemic and are often treated with EPO to

                        water in the blood. Because albumin cannot pass easily through capillary walls, it remains in
                        the blood and<a id="pg479" /> carries smaller molecules bound to its surface. It attracts water
                        from the tissues back into the bloodstream and thus opposes the water’s tendency to leave the
                        blood and leak out into tissue spaces. <b>Edema</b> (swelling) results when too much fluid from
                        blood “leaks” out into tissues. This happens in a mild form when a person ingests too much salt
                        (water is retained in the blood and seeps out into tissues) and in a severe form when a person
                        is burned in a fire. In this situation, albumin escapes from capillaries as a result of the burn
                        injury. Then water cannot be held in the blood; it escapes through the skin, and blood volume
                        drops.</div>

                    Then the clot retracts into a tight ball, leaving behind a clear fluid called <b>serum.</b> Serum is
                    related to plasma. It is plasma after the clotting factors have been removed. Normally, clots
                    (thrombi) do not form in blood vessels unless the vessel is damaged or the flow of blood is impeded.
                    <b>Anticoagulant substances</b> in the blood inhibit blood clotting, so clots do not form.
                    <b>Heparin,</b> produced by tissue cells (especially in the liver), is an example of an
                    anticoagulant. Other drugs such as <b>warfarin (Coumadin)</b> are given to patients with
                    thromboembolic diseases to prevent the formation of clots. <b>Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)</b>
                    work by inhibiting blood clotting factors such as thrombin.<span role="doc-pagebreak"

                                <div class="b1text" id="p0670">I was scheduled for a stem cell transplant to cure my
                                    recurrent primary central nervous system lymphoma, or PCNSL, a rare type of brain
                                    cancer. Until around 15 years ago, stem cell transplants depended upon bone marrow
                                    from which to harvest the cells. Since then, scientists have discovered that there
                                    are actually more cells available in peripheral (circulating) blood than in marrow.
                                    I was given two medicines, Mozobil and Neupogen, aimed at stimulating enough stem
                                    cells to be collected from that peripheral source. In a peripheral autologous blood
                                    stem cell transplant, stem cells are collected from the circulating blood by
                                    apheresis, in which blood is withdrawn through a sterile needle, and passed through
                                    a machine that harvests stem cells into a container, while the remaining blood
                                    components are then transferred back into the patient’s bloodstream. The fraction
                                    containing the blood stem cells is then frozen until needed for transplantation.
                                    Because patients get their own cells back, no chance exists for immune mismatch or
                                    graft-versus-host problems.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p0675">On the first day of stem cell collection, I produced half
                                    of the total stem cells I would need for my treatment. By the end of the third day
                                    of collection, I had reached the magic number of stem cells needed, and was able to
                                    go home to wait for the hospital to schedule me for the transplant. A representative
                                    phoned 2 days later, laying out the next 5 weeks for me: I’d be admitted in 11 days
                                    to the transplant division, where I would remain, they hoped, for no more than a
                                    month. My (presumably clean) stem cells were safely stored in a freezer while I was
                                    to undergo intensive chemotherapy meant to destroy any lurking cancer cells in my
                                    brain (and, of course, benign others in the medicine’s “take-no-prisoners” path).

                                <div class="b1text" id="p0680">I was glad when the date arrived, and my husband, Dennis,
                                    moved me into my next month’s home on the eighth floor of the hospital. What I had
                                    failed to understand is the nature of an autologous stem cell transplant, at least
                                    for primary CNS lymphoma. I was to be blasted, rendered helpless, with a trio of
                                    chemo agents able to pass through the blood-brain barrier, but not ordinarily
                                    available for treatment-as-a-threesome due to their combined viciousness: busulfan,
                                    thiotepa (mustard gas–related), and cyclophosphamide (also a nitrogen mustard
                                    alkylating agent). I could risk receiving these killers because my uncontaminated
                                    stem cells were stored in the freezer. They would eventually replace my currently
                                    circulating blood that was being saturated with chemotherapy agents.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p0685">After 9 days, my white blood count was as low as it could
                                    go: I was at ground zero, “my second birthday.” The blood we’d collected with the
                                    help of Mozobil and company was slowly thawed, for a few hours, and soon I was given
                                    a transfusion of my previously frozen blood, swarming with stem cells. Before long,
                                    I felt so sick I thought I was dying. Wearing diapers that had to be changed every
                                    20 minutes, having rectal samples taken from my chafed, sometimes bloody “toilet
                                    skin” (as the nurse called it), being forced to sit up every minute, even at night,
                                    so that I could put the suction tube down my throat to keep from drowning in the
                                    rope-like mucositis, which ulcerated the membranes lining my digestive system—I
                                    could go on and on.</div>
                                <div class="b1text" id="p0690">But as I’d been promised, nearly 5 weeks post-admission
                                    for the life-giving stem cell transplant, I was deemed ready to go home. For a
                                    month, however, our house operated like a medical office. That first week, I kept
                                    down half a shake a day. When I returned for my first checkup, I had to stay an
                                    extra 5 hours for a hydration infusion. Four days later, my red blood count was low
                                    and I needed a transfusion. By the second week, I’d started eating Cheerios with
                                    milk throughout the day, and my weight at least stabilized. I no longer looked like
                                    a skeleton.</div>

                                    worried that Dennis would find my scrawniness a turnoff, but he accepted my new
                                    “boy’s body” and enthusiastically helped me recapture my faith in our oneness. After
                                    all, we’d been through the battle and needed now to smell the perennial flowers.
